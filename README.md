# Inventory
C#/.NET Final Project March 2018

This project solves a problem that regularly arises at my company. We rent heavy equipment, and currently don't have a quick, mobile-friendly application that keeps track of available and non-available equipment. I decided to go ahead and add attachments as well (buckets, hydraulic hammers, hydraulic thumbs, etc.). This is not a full list of our equipment and attachments. It is simply a demonstration of skills learned in the Code Louisville C#/.NET course. However, after adding basic authentication and proper seeding, it could potentially be implemented.
