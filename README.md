# Inventory
C#/.NET Final Project March 2018

The first step after extracting the files is to seed the database - open the Package Manager Console, type in "update-database", and hit enter. After this is complete, build and run. You will then be required to register with a username/password. After registering and signing in, navigate the two tables via the navbar. 

Please note that I am still working on validation for the forms, and while I've made progress, I have not pushed that yet. When adding or editing a machine or attachment, use integer values for fleet number and hours (if applicable). 

This project solves a problem that regularly arises at my company. We rent heavy equipment, and currently don't have a quick, mobile-friendly application that keeps track of available and non-available equipment. I decided to go ahead and add attachments as well (buckets, hydraulic hammers, hydraulic thumbs, etc.). This is not a full list of our equipment and attachments. It is simply a demonstration of skills learned in the Code Louisville C#/.NET course. However, it has the potential to become a useful app with a little additional work.
